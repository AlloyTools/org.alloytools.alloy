/**
 * {@code TestInstanceFactory} defines the API for {@link Extension
 * Extensions} that wish to {@linkplain #createTestInstance create} test instances.
 *
 * <p>Common use cases include creating test instances with special construction
 * requirements or acquiring the test instance from a dependency injection
 * framework.
 *
 * <p>Extensions that implement {@code TestInstanceFactory} must be registered
 * at the class level.
 *
 * <h3>Warning</h3>
 *
 * <p>Only one {@code TestInstanceFactory} is allowed to be registered for any
 * given test class. Registering multiple factories for any single test class
 * will result in an exception being thrown for all tests in that class, in any
 * subclass, and in any nested class. Note that any {@code TestInstanceFactory}
 * registered in a {@linkplain Class#getSuperclass() superclass} or
 * {@linkplain Class#getEnclosingClass() enclosing} class (i.e., in the case of
 * a {@code @Nested} test class) is <em>inherited</em>. It is therefore the
 * user's responsibility to ensure that only a single {@code TestInstanceFactory}
 * is registered for any specific test class.
 *
 * <h3>Constructor Requirements</h3>
 *
 * <p>Consult the documentation in {@link Extension} for details on
 * constructor requirements.
 *
 * @since 5.3
