/**
 * {@code @ResourceLock} is used to declare that the annotated test class or test
 * method requires access to a shared resource identified by a key.
 *
 * <p>The resource key is specified via {@link #value}. In addition,
 * {@link #mode} allows you to specify whether the annotated test class or test
 * method requires {@link ResourceAccessMode#READ_WRITE READ_WRITE} or only
 * {@link ResourceAccessMode#READ READ} access to the resource. In the former case,
 * execution of the annotated element will occur while no other test class or
 * test method that uses the shared resource is being executed. In the latter case,
 * the annotated element may be executed concurrently with other test classes or
 * methods that also require {@code READ} access but not at the same time as any
 * other test that requires {@code READ_WRITE} access.
 *
 * <p>This annotation can be repeated to declare the use of multiple shared resources.
 *
 * <p>Since JUnit Jupiter 5.4, this annotation is {@linkplain Inherited inherited}
 * within class hierarchies.
