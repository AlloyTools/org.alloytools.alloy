/**
 * {@code @TestFactory} is used to signal that the annotated method is a
 * <em>test factory</em> method.
 *
 * <p>In contrast to {@link Test @Test} methods, a test factory is not itself
 * a test case but rather a factory for test cases.
 *
 * <p>{@code @TestFactory} methods must not be {@code private} or {@code static}
 * and must return a {@code Stream}, {@code Collection}, {@code Iterable},
 * {@code Iterator}, or array of {@link DynamicNode} instances. Supported
 * subclasses of {@code DynamicNode} include {@link DynamicContainer} and
 * {@link DynamicTest}. <em>Dynamic tests</em> will be executed lazily,
 * enabling dynamic and even non-deterministic generation of test cases.
 *
 * <p>Any {@code Stream} returned by a {@code @TestFactory} will be properly
 * closed by calling {@code stream.close()}, making it safe to use a resource
 * such as {@code Files.lines()} as the initial source of the stream.
 *
 * <p>{@code @TestFactory} methods may optionally declare parameters to be
 * resolved by {@link org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ParameterResolver
 * ParameterResolvers}.
 *
 * <h3>Test Execution Order</h3>
 *
 * <p>By default, test methods will be ordered using an algorithm that is
 * deterministic but intentionally nonobvious. This ensures that subsequent runs
 * of a test suite execute test methods in the same order, thereby allowing for
 * repeatable builds. In this context, a <em>test method</em> is any instance
 * method that is directly annotated or meta-annotated with {@code @Test},
 * {@code @RepeatedTest}, {@code @ParameterizedTest}, {@code @TestFactory}, or
 * {@code @TestTemplate}.
 *
 * <p>Although true <em>unit tests</em> typically should not rely on the order
 * in which they are executed, there are times when it is necessary to enforce
 * a specific test method execution order &mdash; for example, when writing
 * <em>integration tests</em> or <em>functional tests</em> where the sequence of
 * the tests is important, especially in conjunction with
 * {@link TestInstance @TestInstance(Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)}.
 *
 * <p>To control the order in which test methods are executed, annotate your
 * test class or test interface with {@link TestMethodOrder @TestMethodOrder}
 * and specify the desired {@link MethodOrderer} implementation.
