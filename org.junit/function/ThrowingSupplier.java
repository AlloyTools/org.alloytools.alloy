/**
 * {@code ThrowingSupplier} is a functional interface that can be used to
 * implement any generic block of code that returns an object and
 * potentially throws a {@link Throwable}.
 *
 * <p>The {@code ThrowingSupplier} interface is similar to
 * {@link java.util.function.Supplier}, except that a {@code ThrowingSupplier}
 * can throw any kind of exception, including checked exceptions.
 *
 * <h4>Rationale for throwing {@code Throwable} instead of {@code Exception}</h4>
 *
 * <p>Although Java applications typically throw exceptions that are instances
 * of {@link Exception}, {@link RuntimeException},
 * {@link Error}, or {@link AssertionError} (in testing
 * scenarios), there may be use cases where a {@code ThrowingSupplier} needs to
 * explicitly throw a {@code Throwable}. In order to support such specialized
 * use cases, {@link #get} is declared to throw {@code Throwable}.
