Dash is a new language for the formal specification of abstract behavioural models, which combines the control-oriented constructs of statecharts with the declarative modelling of Alloy. From statecharts, Dash inherits a means to specify hierarchy, concurrency, and communication, three useful aspects to describe the behaviour of reactive systems. From Alloy, Dash uses the expressiveness of relational logic and set theory to abstractly and declaratively describe structures, data, and operations.

This repository contains the code to build the Dash parser and translator and the website to convert a Dash model to Alloy
