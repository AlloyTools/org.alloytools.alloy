# Dash: Declarative Abstract State hierarchy
---

Dash is a new language for the formal specification of abstract behavioural 
models, which combines the control-oriented constructs of statecharts with the 
declarative modelling of <a href="http://alloytools.org/" target="_blank">Alloy</a>.
From statecharts, Dash inherits a means to specify hierarchy, concurrency, and 
communication, three useful aspects to describe the behaviour of reactive systems.
From Alloy, Dash uses the expressiveness of relational logic and set theory to 
abstractly and declaratively describe structures, data, and operations.


This repository contains the code to build the Dash parser and translator and 
the <a href="http://http://dash.uwaterloo.ca:8080" target="_blank">website</a>
to convert a Dash model to Alloy and contains further documentation
about Dash.
