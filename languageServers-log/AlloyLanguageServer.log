They invite four couples who are friends for dinner. When\n * they arrive, they shake hands with each other. Nobody shakes hands with him or herself\n * or with his or her spouse. After there has been some handshaking, Jocelyn jumps up on\n * a chair and says \"Stop shaking hands!\", and then asks how many hands each person has\n * shaken. All the answers are different. How many hands has Hilary shaken?\n *\n * The Alloy model represents the problem as a set of constraints. Properties of the spouse\n * relationship and of handshaking in general are given as facts. The particular situation\n * is cast as a function.\n *\n * There are 9 people answering, and all answers are different. Nobody can shake more than\n * 8 hands. So answers must be 0..8. The one (p8 say) who answered 8 has shaken everybody\u0027s\n * hand except for his or her own, and his or her spouse\u0027s. Now consider the person who shook\n * 0 hands (p0 say). The persons p0 and p8 are distinct. If they are not married, then p8 cannot\n * have shaken 8 hands, because he or she did not shake the hand of p0 or of his or her spouse.\n * So p8\u0027s spouse to p0. Now imagine Jocelyn asking the question again, with p0 and p8 out of\n * the room, and excluding hand shakes with them. Since p8 shook hands with everyone else\n * except p0 and p8, everyone gives an answer one smaller than they did before, giving 0..6.\n * The argument now applies recursively.
