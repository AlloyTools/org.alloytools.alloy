# README.md

Dash.cup and Dash.lex were created by the script install-alloy.files.sh, 
which does some renaming and integrates the various parts of the lexer/grammar needed for Dash.

Do NOT edit Dash.lex or Dash.cup directly.

If Alloy is updated, rerun this script. 

If any of Dash-cup-*.txt or Dash-lex-*.txt are edited, rerun this script.
