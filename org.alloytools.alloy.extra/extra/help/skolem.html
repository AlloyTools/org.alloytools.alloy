<h2>Skolemization Relations </h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Often times, quantified formulas can be reduced to equivalent formulas without the use of quantifiers.<br>
This reduction is called <strong>skolemization</strong> and is based on the introduction of one or more <strong>skolem constants or functions</strong><br>
that capture the constraint of the quantified formula in their values. </p>
<p>Consider the following example:</p>
<pre>sig A { r: lone B }
sig B {}</pre>
<pre>fact {
    some x: A | no x.r
}</pre>
<p>The &quot;some&quot; formula may be equivalently expressed as:</p>
<pre>    x' in A &amp;&amp; no x'.r </pre>
<p><em>x' </em> is the skolem relation in this case. The existential quantifier &quot;some&quot; is not needed because the analysis will search for the existence of the skolem relation<em>x'</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Determining the names of skolem relations </h3>
<p>The Alloy Analyzer automatically generates and assigns names to skolem relations.<br>
The names can be determined by looking at the solved instance using any of the three (Text, Tree, Viz) views.<br>
For instance, in the above example, the name <em>$x</em> may have been assigned to the skolem relation <em>x'</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Using skolem relations</h3>
<p>Skolem relations are displayed in the output like any other relation in the original model. Hence, its visualization may be customized to be made more conspicuous.
