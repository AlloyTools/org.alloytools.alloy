<h2>Tree View </h2>
<p>As implied by its name, the Tree view displays an instance in a tree.
The nodes of the tree may be expanded/collapsed to reveal/hide the values
of relations. A relation node (such as that for a signature or a field)
is expanded to reveal its tuples, and an atom may be expanded to reveal
the value of joining the atom with the fields defined in its corresponding
signature.</p>
