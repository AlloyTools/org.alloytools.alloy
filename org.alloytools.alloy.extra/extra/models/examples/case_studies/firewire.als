 *
 * This model describes a leader election protocol used in Firewire, an IEEE
 * standard for connecting consumer electronic devices. The model is a
 * straightforward translation into Alloy of a model [DG+01] developed in Lynch's
 * IO Automata which has been analyzed using PVS, a theorem prover, but which, as
 * far as we know, has not been subjected to fully automatic analysis. We are able
 * to express the key correctness property -- that exactly one leader is elected
 * -- more directly, as a trace property rather than a refinement property, and
 * can check it without the need for the 15 invariants used in the more
 * traditional proof. And the analysis does not hardwire
 * a particular topology, so would be tricky to do with a standard model checker.
 *
 * The network is assumed to consist of a collection of nodes connected by
 * links. Each link between a pair of nodes is matched by a link in the other
 * direction. Viewing a link and its dual as a single, undirected edge, the
 * network as a whole is assumed to form a tree. The purpose of the algorithm is
 * to construct such a tree; in the model, this is achieved by labelling some
 * subset of the links as parent links (each pointing from a node to its parent),
 * and by marking a single node as the root.
 *
 * The algorithm, described in detail elsewhere [DG+01], works briefly as
 * follows. When a node detects that all of its incoming links (or all but one)
 * has been marked as a parent link, it sends a message on each outgoing link,
 * either an acknowledgment (indicating its willingness to act as parent), or a
 * request (indicating its desire to be a child), according to whether the dual of
 * the outgoing link has been marked or not. Leaf nodes (with only one incoming
 * link) may thus initiate the algorithm by sending requests to their adjacent
 * nodes. Performing this action changes a node's status from {\em waiting} to
 * {\em active}. A node that is still waiting, and which receives a message on a
 * link, may label that link a parent link. Once active, a node that receives an
 * acknowledgment on a link may also label the link, but if it receives a request,
 * instead changes its node status to {\em contending}. The resolving of
 * contentions is modelled simplistically by a single action that arbitrarily
 * labels one of the two links a pair of contending nodes. Finally, a node all of
 * whose incoming links are parent links designates itself a root.
 *
 * The specification is given below. Each signature introduces a basic type
 * and some relations whose first column has that type:
 *
 * \begin{itemize}
 *
 * \item {\em Msg} represents the type of messages. {\em Req} is the request
 * message and {\em Ack} is the acknowledgment message; these are actually
 * declared as singleton (keyword {\em static}) subsets of {\em Msg}, the set of
 * all messages, that form a partition (keyword {\em part}).
 *
 * \item {\em Node} represents the nodes of the network. The relations {\em to}
 * and {\em from} associate each node with a set of incoming and outgoing links
 * respectively.
 *
 * \item {\em Link} represents the links. The relations {\em target} and {\em
 * source} map a link to its end nodes; {\em reverse} maps a link to its dual. The
 * facts in the signatures {\em Node} and {\em Link} ensure that all these
 * relations are consistent with one another: that the incoming links of a node
 * are those whose target is that node, etc.
 *
 * \item {\em Op} introduces a set of names for the operations of the
 * protocol. This is merely for convenience; it allows us to ask for an execution
 * in which named operations occur, or example.
 *
 * \item {\em State} represents the global states. Each state has a partition of
 * the nodes into one of four statuses: {\em waiting} to participate, {\em active}
 * (having sent messages on outgoing links), {\em contending} (having sent a
 * request on a link and received a request on its dual), and {\em elected}
 * (having designated itself as a root). A set of links are labelled as parent
 * links. There is a message queue associated with each link. Finally, the state
 * is associated with the operation that produced it.
 *
 * \item {\em Queue} represents the message queues. Each queue has a slot that
 * optionally contains a message; the relation {\em slot} is a partial function
 * from queues to messages. In our first attempt at a model, we represented a
 * queue as a sequence (a partial function from a prefix of the integers to
 * messages), but having checked that no queue ever contained more than one
 * message, we simplified the model. The {\em overflow} field is included just in
 * case this was a mistake; a write to a queue that already contains a message
 * puts an arbitrary value there, which is easily detected.
 *
 * \end{itemize}
 *
 * The {\em facts} record the assumptions about the topology. The one named {\em
 * Topology} says that there is some partial function on nodes and some root such
 * that (1) every node is reachable from the root ({\tt *r} being the reflexive
 * transitive closure of the relation {\tt r}); (2) there are no cycles (expressed
 * by saying that the transitive closure has no intersection with the identity
 * relation on nodes); and (3) the relation obtained by following the {\em source}
 * relation backwards (from a node to the link for which it is a source), and then
 * the {\em target} relation forwards (from the link to its target) is this
 * relation, plus its transpose (so that each tree edge becomes two
 * links). Although the quantifier appears to be higher-order, it will be
 * skolemized away by the analyzer.
 *
 * The {\em functions} of the model are parameterized formulas. The function {\em
 * Trans} relates a pre-state {\tt s} to a post-state {\tt s"}. It has a case for
 * each operation. Look at the clause for the operation {\em WriteReqOrAck}, for
 * example. If this operation is deemed to have occurred, each of the constraints
 * in the curly braces must hold. The first says that the labelling of links as
 * parent links is unchanged. The second constraint (the quantified formula)
 * constrains with respect to the node at which the operation occurs. The
 * subformulas, from first to last, say that the node belongs to the waiting set
 * before and the active set afterwards; that there is at most one ({\em sole})
 * link that is incoming but not a parent link in the pre-state; that there are no
 * changes to node status except at this node; that a message is queued onto each
 * outgoing link; and that queues on all other links are unchanged.
 *
 * An 'invoked' function is simply short for the formula in its body with the
 * formal arguments replaced by the actual expressions. {\em WriteQueue}, for
 * example, says that if the queue's slot is not filled in the pre-state, then the
 * new queue in the post-state (given the local name {\tt q}) contains the message
 * {\tt m} in its slot, and has no message in its overflow. Otherwise, some
 * message is placed arbitrarily in the overflow, and the slot is
 * unconstrained. In {\em WriteReqOrAck}, the arguments {\tt s} and {\tt s"} are
 * bound to the {\tt s} and {\tt s"} of {\em Trans}; {\tt x} is bound to one of
 * the outgoing links from the set {\tt n.from}; and {\tt msg} is bound either to
 * the acknowledgment or request message.
 *
 * The function {\em Execution} constrains the set of states. It makes use of a
 * library module that defines a polymorphic ordering relation. The expression
 * {\tt Ord[State]} gives an ordering on all states. The two formulas of the
 * function say that {\tt Initialization} holds in the first state, and that any
 * pair of adjacent states is related by {\tt Trans}. The function {\em NoRepeats}
 * adds the constraints that there are no equivalent states in the trace, and that
 * no stuttering occurs.
 *
 * The three assertions are theorems for which the analyzer will search for
 * counterexamples. They assert respectively that: in every state of the trace,
 * there is at most one node that has been elected; that there is some state in
 * which a node has been elected; and that no queue overflows.
 *
 * The rest of the model is a collection of commands executed to find instances of
 * the functions or counterexamples to the theorems. We started by presenting a
 * variety of functions as a sanity check; here, only one is given, that asks for
 * an execution involving 2 nodes, 4 links, 4 queues and a trace of 6 states. The
 * standard semantics of these {\em scope} declarations in Alloy is that the
 * numbers represent an upper bound, so an instance may involve fewer than 4
 * queues, for example. The ordering module (not shown here), however, for
 * technical reasons, constrains the ordered set to match its scope, so a trace
 * with fewer than 6 states will not be acceptable.
 *
 * We then established some bounds on the diameter of the state machine for
 * various topology bounds. For 2 nodes and 2 links, for example, there are no
 * non-repeating traces of length 4; checking traces of length 3 is thus
 * sufficient in this case. The number of queues was limited to 5, to accommodate
 * the empty queue, a queue containing an {\tt Ack} or {\tt Req}, and each of
 * these with overflow. For 3 nodes and 6 links, a trace length of 8 suffices.
 *
 * We then checked that for these various topology bounds, the queues never
 * overflow. Finally, we checked the correctness properties, taken advantage of
 * the earlier results that justify the short traces and queues. We are thus able
 * to verify the properties for all topologies involving the given number of nodes
 * and links, without any assumptions about trace length, queue size or the
 * particular topological structure.
